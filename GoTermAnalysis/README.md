# In depth analysis of CLIP-Seq dataset

DESeq2 analysis was previously performed on the Rbp1 CLIP-Seq dataset (Master thesis Andreas Sch√§ffler). The aim here was to delve deeper into the DESeq2 results to extract biologically relevant information. For this, a GO terms enrichement analysis was performed as well as some comparison between the different datasets (experiments and controls).
Here are the DESeq2 files as well as all scripts used for the in depth analysis.

**add table to summarize what each skript does**

**add aims, methods (and maybe also conclusions?)**
