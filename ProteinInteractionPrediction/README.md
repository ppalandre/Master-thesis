# Protein interaction prediction of Rbp1 and potential interactors using AlphaFold Multimer

In a previously performed co-immunoprecipitation of Rbp1 (Master thesis Andreas Sch√§ffler), potential interactors of Rbp1 were identified. The aim here is to use AlphaFold Multimer to model the interaction between Rbp1 and some of the hits.
In this folder are all fasta files used for the modelling. The exact parameters of the AlphaFold Multimer runs will be put here as well.

**add aims, methods (and maybe also conclusions?) and Quellenangaben und Webseiten-Links (zu Alphafold Multimer)**
**add AlphaFold multimer parameters, evtl. als screenshot der webseite**
