# Master thesis - Role of Rbp1 in RNA localization in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803

The goal of my master thesis is to investigate the role of RNA binding protein 1 in RNA localization in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. For this, I used both bioinformatic tools and I performed wet lab experiments. This repository contains all the scripts I used as well as the raw data I collected sorted in the following categories: 

| Folder | Description |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Absorption spectra             | UV-vis spectra of Synechocystis wild-type, <br>Rbp1 mutant and tagged Rbp1 complemented mutants <br>(GFP or FLAG) grown in 20 Â°C to investigate physio-<br>logical effects of Rbp1 deletion on growth and <br>photosynthetic pigment content. |
| FISH                           | Images and image analysis pipeline for fluorescence <br>*in situ* experiments investigating the localization of <br>Rbp1-bound transcripts in wild-type, mutant and comple-<br>mentant cells.                                                 |
| GOTermAnalysis                 | In depth analysis results of Rbp1 CLIP-Seq data.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Protein Interaction Prediction | Prediction of complexes built between Rbp1 and proteins <br>pulled down in a co-immunoprecipitaion experiment using <br>AlphaFold Multimer.                                                                                                   |
