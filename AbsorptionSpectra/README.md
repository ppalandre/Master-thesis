# Absorption Spectra

I performed UV vis absorption spectra to investigate physiological effects of Rbp1 deletion on the growth and photosynthetic pigments content of Synechocystis under cold shock. Different conditions of temperature and light where tested out: 20 °C and 75 $\mu$E light or 15 °C and 140 $\mu$E light.
In this folder are all the absorption measurements as well as the Python scripts used to normalize the data and plot the absorption spectra and growth curves.
