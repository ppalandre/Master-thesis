# Fluorescence *in situ* hybridization

To validate the CLIP-Seq dataset, some of the transcripts will be vizualized using fluorescent probes in Synechocystis cells. Co-localization with GFP-tagged Rbp1 will be analyzed as well. 
This folder contains the potential FISH targets, chosen within the CLIP-Seq results as transcripts that were proven to bind Rbp1 in cold shock conditions and transcripts that do not as a negative control. Once performed, the FISH raw images as well as the image analysis workflow will be added here as well.
